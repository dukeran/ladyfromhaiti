      I tell visitors the story behind my colorful shop on Fifth Avenue South
      in Naples, Florida there
      is a timeline that weaves two stories and
      two lives together. The real &#8220;Lady from Haiti,&#8221; for whom the
      store is named, is my adopted daughter, Rachel. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It all began in the mid 1980&#8217;s when I went to Haiti as a teacher. I stayed
      for six years teaching second grade in a private school and the American Red
      Cross swimming program after school and in the summertime. <img src="images/aboutus3.jpg" width="197" height="144" hspace="4" vspace="2" align="left"><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a couple years I said to myself that it was
      time to leave the island and to get on with my life. Maybe begin a family. But
      I just couldn&#8217;t make
      myself actually break away. Each year I&#8217;d sell my car and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s
      it!&#8221; but I always ended up staying. I bought and sold three cars that
      way,
      and for the longest time I just couldn&#8217;t <img src="images/melody.jpg" hspace="5" align="right">figure under what spell
      I
      was
      living.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally the mystery of why leaving Haiti was so
      difficult was solved for me. A beautiful Haitian baby girl, whose natural mother
      could not afford to care
      for her, was about to be born, and it was a match made in heaven.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I first saw Rachel on a sonogram, and we met face
      to face six weeks later, when Rachel was exactly one month old. As
      soon as all
      the red tape and bureaucratic
      requirements were met, we two ladies from Haiti were allowed to leave the country
      and begin our lives together.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;The Lady from Haiti&#8221; Caribbean art
      gallery and gift boutique thus came into being. Rachel has grown up with the
      assurance that her native culture
      is wonderfully creative and exciting, and I am able to be my own boss in the
      sometimes stressful and often isolating world of single motherhood. It&#8217;s
      a win-win-win situation for everybody. I can&#8217;t get fired when I&#8217;m
      late too often; Rachel has a unique definition in Naples; and people absolutely
      love
      the Haitian colors and Haitian spirit shining through the artwork.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years ago when my father
      passed, he left his children a note saying his legacy to us was love. At the
      time I really couldn't comprehend all that he meant by that. Now, as a parent
      myself, I certainly do. Our store is my labor of love for my daughter, and I
      am a very lucky lady in being able to provide for her in the way that I do.<br>
