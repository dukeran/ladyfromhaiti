&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For special &#8220;creature comforts&#8221; to be found while in Naples shopping,
try our unusual glycerin soap rocks on wooden slat racks. You&#8217;ll have a
hard time believing it&#8217;s not a real rose quartz, fire opal, or piece of
gorgeous lapis lazuli. Great hostess gifts&#8230; and so are our classic palm
tree and sunburst dishtowels. Or choose seashell or flamingo placemats and <u>La
Cuisine de Margot</u> authentic Haitian cookbook.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt Naples&#8217; many golf courses enjoy superb reputations, and we even
carry humorous &#8220;word pillows&#8221; to comfort Naples golfers with such
expressions as &#8220;I&#8217;m not over the hill, I&#8217;m on the back nine,&#8221; and &#8220;Eat,
Sleep, and Golf.&#8221;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caribbean or tropical art, Haitian folk art in
particular, is often described as charming, whimsical, and intriguing. How do
these sound to you&#8230;.a curly-tailed gecko keychain, a micro hook palm tree
for your keys, a looking-glass mermaid magnet, an emperor angelfish soap dish,
or a tree frog paper clip dish?
The Lady from Haiti carries many small knick knack and gift ideas including twelve
different types of cotton island dolls.

and African musical diaspora C.D.s, and even bread dipping and oil sets. We address
all the senses!</td>
