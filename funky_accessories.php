      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lady from Haiti is for you if you enjoy sporting
      unusual and hard to find jewelry, belts and sashes, calabash shoulder slings,
      and
            Caribbean color-inspired feathered purses and evening bags. We love
            bright, colorful folk art; we love to be surrounded by art; and wearing
            art is the ultimate demonstration of singer Cyndi Lauper&#8217;s
            claim that &#8220;girls just wanna have fun!&#8221; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our funky accessories are only for the woman who likes
to set herself apart from the ordinary. There are clunky wooden / bone bracelets,
glass bead bangles, gecko
watches, turtle toe rings, beach life earrings, slinky beaded cell phone bags,
and
the
new
adorable
flip
flop
necklaces.</td>
