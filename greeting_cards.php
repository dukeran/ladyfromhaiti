&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds crazy, but it&#8217;s true. You <u>really</u> <u>can</u> mail
a tropical coconut
postcard to your friends back home. We have &#8220;Thank You&#8221; coconuts, &#8220;Happy
Birthday&#8221; coconuts, and &#8220;This coconut fell on my head and that&#8217;s
why I haven&#8217;t written&#8221; coconuts, to name just a few. But don&#8217;t
forget our flip-flop sandal (yes, they&#8217;re real) postcards, authentic banana
leaf greeting cards, the wonderful new &#8220;found objects&#8221; South African
cards, and our soul sistah and brothers line of cards, journals, and stationary.
We also carry bright and flamboyant calendars by Gullah artist Jonathan Green,
and of course, cards emblazoned with Haitian paintings.</td>
