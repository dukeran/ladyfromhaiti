     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naples art galleries and Fifth Avenue South shopping
     are world renowned.  &#8220;The
     Lady from Haiti&#8221; Haitian Art Gallery and Funky Boutique is one of
     the reasons that is so. This amazing little spot is chock full of Haitian
     folk art made from recycled and painted 55-gallon steel drums, among other
     things. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This art form is relatively new in Haiti, dating back approximately sixty years,
and by most accounts, originating with M. Georges Liautaud, a mechanic and metal
worker from a small town outside of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Cast-off steel drums
are reborn and painted as beautiful and exotic wall or floor sculptures, towel
racks, napkin holders, and key hooks. </td>
