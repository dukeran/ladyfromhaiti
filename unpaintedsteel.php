&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before a Haitian artisan may begin his sculpted
creation, the last remaining contents of the 55-gallon drum he will use are
burned out. Once the drum is cooled, the top and bottom are cut off and transformed
into  24&#8221; circular
  wall designs. The screw tops and / or threads often become mermaids&#8217; earrings
  or sculpted children&#8217;s hoop toys.  
  On the remainder of the 3&#8217; x 6&#8217; drum, various designs are chalked
and then cut out with a cold chisel and a ball-peen hammer. Jagged edges are
filed smooth, and if left <i>au naturel</i> the steel drum sculpture will be varnished
only, <i>et voila!</i> Recycling at its artistic best.</td>
